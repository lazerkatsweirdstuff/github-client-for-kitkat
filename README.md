# PLEASE READ THE HOW TO USE SECTION HERE

### _Step 1: Create PAT_

*You need to use a computer for this step*

For this you will need a PAT (Personal Access Token). [Read this on how to do that.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) 

## REMEMBER TO TURN ON ALL SCOPES SO YOU CAN ACCESS ALL OF YOUR REPOS AND _DONT_ SET IT TO A FINE GRAINED TOKEN. ALSO WRITE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE SAFE (eg. A file on your desktop) AS YOU WONT SEE IT AGAIN.

### _Step 2: Use program_

*You can use your phone now for this step*

Open the website (Listed above) and write your github username (NOT DISPLAY NAME) into the "Github username" section.

Paste in your PAT (Created in the step above)

Hit login! You can now access your github repos
